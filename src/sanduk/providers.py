"""Model providers and the wire protocols they speak.

A provider is where requests go and how they are authenticated. A protocol is
how a request body and a usage block are shaped. The two are not 1:1: OpenAI
serves Responses and Chat Completions on different paths of the same host, and
those two name their token counts differently.

The protocol cannot be recovered from a response body. Anthropic Messages and
OpenAI Responses both report `input_tokens` and `output_tokens`, so a sniffer
reading field names alone cannot tell them apart. `Provider.routes` declares it
per path instead.

Only Anthropic is implemented. A second provider is a `Provider` row and a
`PROVIDERS` entry.
