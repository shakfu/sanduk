"""Assistants: an identity, a schedule and a mailbox around `sanduk run`.

`run` is one container and no memory of it. An assistant is a directory whose
`assistant.toml` says how to run, a `workspace/` the agent keeps its memory in,
and a SQLite file holding what has to outlive a run: when the next wakeup is
due, which process owns one now, what came in and what went out.

Nothing here starts a container. A wakeup composes a task and calls the `run`
command, so an assistant can do nothing a typed `sanduk run` cannot.

Config is a file the operator edits and the database is bookkeeping only. A
schedule that lived in the database would be edited through a verb nobody wants
to write, and a queue that lived in a file would need the locking SQLite has.
