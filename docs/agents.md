# Agent handlers

sanduk runs one agent CLI inside the container and reads its JSON stream. What that CLI is, how it is driven, and how its output is parsed live in a handler. Seven ship: `claude`, `codex`, `hax`, `hermes`, `opencode`, `pi` and `prime`. An eighth is a class you write, in your own package. `prime` is a subclass of `pi`: two builds of one CLI, where only the variable names, one flag and the image differ.

## What a handler answers

| | |
|-|-|
| `name` | the `--agent` value and the registry key |
| `recipe` | the recipe that builds the image; see [docs/dev/kits.md](dev/kits.md) |
| `skills_dir` | where the agent reads skills, relative to its home; `None` if unknown |
| `image`, `containerfile` | instead of `recipe`: a prebuilt image and the Containerfile that builds it. Takes no kits |
| `protocols` | wire protocols the agent speaks, from `sanduk.providers` |
| `argv()` | flags appended after the image in the container command |
| `wire()` | the variables the agent reads its endpoint and credential from |
| `reader()` | a fresh `Reader` per run, which consumes the JSON stream |

The runner knows none of it. Adding an agent touches no file in `sanduk`.

## A minimal handler

```python
from sanduk import Agent, Outcome, Reader, Wiring
from sanduk.providers import OPENAI_CHAT


class MyReader(Reader):
    def __init__(self):
        self.result = None

    def event(self, record, quiet):
        if record.get("type") == "done":
            self.result = record
        elif not quiet and record.get("type") == "say":
            print(f"  . {record['text'][:160]}")

    def finish(self):
        if self.result is None:
            return None
        return Outcome(ok=True, text=self.result["text"], stats="1 turn")


class MyAgent(Agent):
    name = "mine"
    image = "my-agent:latest"
    containerfile = Path("/path/to/Containerfile.mine")
    protocols = frozenset({OPENAI_CHAT})

    def argv(self, args, provider, task, wiring):
        # wiring carries this run's endpoint, for an agent that takes it as an
        # option rather than from the environment.
        return ["--json", task]

    def wire(self, args, provider, root):
        return Wiring(
            key_env="MY_API_KEY",
            base_url_env="MY_BASE_URL",
            base_url=(root or f"{provider.scheme}://{provider.host}")
            + provider.api_prefix,
        )

    def reader(self):
        return MyReader()
```

Run it without packaging anything:

```sh
sanduk run 'Review this.' --agent mypkg.handlers:MyAgent --provider openai --proxy
```

Or advertise it, and it appears in `--agent` by name:

```toml
[project.entry-points."sanduk.agents"]
mine = "mypkg.handlers:MyAgent"
```

A plugin that fails to import is reported and skipped, and one that claims a shipped name is refused: replacing `claude` would change what runs in the container without changing the command line.

## Five things that are easy to get wrong

**The base URL prefix is yours to add.** The relay forwards paths unchanged and checks them against `Provider.routes`, so the base URL you hand the agent has to end where those routes begin. `provider.api_prefix` is that segment: `/v1` for most, `/api/v1` for OpenRouter. Claude Code is the exception that proves it — it appends `/v1/messages` itself, so its handler passes the bare root.

**Not every agent reads its endpoint from a variable.** codex takes it as a `-c` config override in `argv`; opencode takes a whole JSON config through `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`; pi reads a `models.json` its image's entrypoint writes from one. That is why `argv` is handed the run's `Wiring`. The credential still travels in `Wiring.key_env` and is named, not inlined, in either: `argv` is visible to `inspect`, and a config file written into the bind mount would be editable by the agent reading it.

**Not every agent streams JSON.** `Reader.event` takes records; `Reader.line` takes every line that is not one, and does nothing by default. hermes prints prose, so its reader reads lines and its `event` is empty. Read what the agent actually prints before writing either: hermes has no per-tool-call line at all, and a trace built from its status prose reported `> Available` for `🔧 Available tools: 20`.

**A handler is stateless; a reader is not.** The registry holds handler classes and `launch` calls `reader()` once per run. Keep the token tally and the final record on the reader, or one run's counts leak into the next.

**Token counts are not comparable across agents.** Claude Code reports cache reads outside `input_tokens`; hax normalizes them inside it. `Outcome.stats` is a formatted line, not a struct, because there is no shared meaning to normalize to.

## Refusing a run early

`Agent.check()` runs before the image is built. The base implementation refuses a provider whose protocols the agent does not speak. Override it to refuse a flag your agent has no equivalent for — silently dropping `--allowed-tools` would weaken a restriction the caller asked for.
