"""The agent strategy: what sanduk needs to know about a CLI it runs.

An agent handler answers four questions and nothing else: which image carries
the program, what flags drive it headlessly, which variables it reads its
endpoint and credential from, and how to read the JSON it streams back. The
runner knows none of those answers, so a new agent is a new handler and no edit
here.

Handlers are looked up in the `sanduk.agents` entry-point group, so a handler in
a separate distribution is found the same way the shipped ones are. `--agent
mypkg.handlers:MyAgent` loads one that is not packaged at all.

Reading the stream is stateful and the handler is not: `Agent.reader()` returns
a fresh `Reader` per run. That keeps a handler safe to hold in the registry and
keeps one run's token tally out of the next one's.

Token accounting is per agent, not per provider: Claude Code reports cache reads
outside `input_tokens` and hax normalizes them inside it, so a shared summary
line would silently miscount one of them. See docs/agents.md to write your own.
