"""PrimeIntellect's `prime-agent`, which is pi's CLI in another build.

The release tarball declares `bin: prime-agent` and depends on
`@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, `-ai` and `-tui`, so the flags, the JSON
stream and the `models.json` provider block are pi's. What differs is the
command, the configuration directory, and where the build comes from: a
checksummed release tarball rather than an npm package.

A subclass rather than a copy: the day the two forks diverge in the stream,
one reader has to change and this file says which handler owns the difference.
