# MicroVMs

Status: investigated, 2026-09-10. `--oci-runtime` is implemented; gVisor is measured, Kata is not. Claims cite primary sources; inference is marked.

Scope: whether sanduk should run agents in microVMs, and how.

## Where sanduk already has a VM boundary

- **macOS, Apple's `container`:** every container is its own lightweight VM. No change needed.

- **Linux, Docker:** the agent shares the host kernel. A kernel escape reaches the host, and in `sealed` mode the host is where the key lives: in the sanduk process, not the container.

So the gap is Linux only, and the threat it closes is kernel escape. Boot time does not matter: a measured run takes ~35s, so a microVM's faster start changes nothing.

## Driving a VMM directly: no

Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor, QEMU microvm and crosvm are virtual machine monitors, not container engines. A sanduk engine on one would have to rebuild what Docker does now:

- turn an OCI image into a root filesystem, and supply a kernel;

- create tap devices and a bridge (root) to rebuild the internal network the relay depends on;

- share `/work`. Firecracker has no filesystem sharing: its devices are virtio-net, virtio-block, a serial console and legacy controllers, and block devices are backed by pre-formatted files ([design.md](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/design.md)). `/work` would be a disk image copied in and out;

- stream the agent's stdout over a serial console or vsock;

- need KVM, which exists only on Linux, so macOS gains nothing.

That is a container runtime, written again.

## An OCI runtime under Docker: yes

Docker picks the program that starts each container with `--runtime`. Two candidates:

- **Kata Containers:** a VM per container. "Docker supports Kata Containers since 22.06: `sudo docker run --runtime io.containerd.kata.v2`" ([Limitations.md](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/Limitations.md)).

  - It can use Cloud Hypervisor, Firecracker, QEMU, Dragonball or StratoVirt ([hypervisors.md](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/hypervisors.md)).

  - Outside TEE setups, bind mounts use filesystem sharing, so `/work` should work.

  - Host networking and Podman are unsupported. sanduk uses neither.

- **gVisor (`runsc`):** not a VM. It serves the container's system calls from a user-space kernel. Installed with `sudo runsc install`, run with `docker run --runtime=runsc` ([quick start](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/quick_start/docker/)). Its default platform needs no KVM (inference), so a standard CI runner can test it.

`--oci-runtime NAME` passes the name through as `docker run --runtime NAME`. Apple's engine refuses it. Docker's `default-runtime` in `daemon.json` does the same without sanduk, but for every container on the host.

## What is measured

| | `open` | `sealed` | `/work` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gVisor | CI job `gvisor`; by hand | CI job `gvisor`; by hand | CI job `gvisor`; by hand |
| Kata, Cloud Hypervisor or QEMU | no | no | no |
| Kata, Firecracker | no | no | probably unsupported (inference, from Firecracker's device list) |

The relay works under gVisor. On 2026-09-11 the container suite passed under runsc 20260831 on docker-ce 29.8.0, for hax and claude, including two concurrent `sealed` runs and a round trip through `/work`. gVisor uses the container's network namespace, which sits on the Docker bridge, so the host gateway stays bindable and reachable.

Kata attaches its VM to the same namespace, so the relay should work there too. That is inference; Kata is in `TODO.md`.

## Measuring Kata

Kata's Docker guide uses the deprecated Go runtime, and "Docker support is tested only with QEMU as the VMM". Docker 26+ needs Kata 3.29.0 or newer ([how-to-use-kata-with-docker.md](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/how-to/how-to-use-kata-with-docker.md)). QEMU is therefore the supported case; Cloud Hypervisor and Firecracker are measurements of what happens.

Needs a native Docker daemon, `/dev/kvm` access, and a user that can reach the Docker socket.

1. Install the Go runtime, pinned. The tarball is 1.2GB and unpacks under `opt/kata/`.

   ```sh
   v=4.1.0
   curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/releases/download/$v/kata-go-static-$v-amd64.tar.zst"
   echo "8b32080424c884238ee8d52060fdfd060fbe2b5fdfa4eb9ff2772b382b432b55  kata-go-static-$v-amd64.tar.zst" | sha256sum -c -
   sudo tar --zstd -xf "kata-go-static-$v-amd64.tar.zst" -C /
   /opt/kata/bin/kata-runtime check
   ls /opt/kata/share/defaults/kata-containers/
   ```

   `ls` shows which `configuration-*.toml` files this build ships. That it includes Cloud Hypervisor and Firecracker is inference.

2. Register the shim with Docker. Merge into any existing `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

   ```json
   { "runtimes": { "kata": { "runtimeType": "/opt/kata/bin/containerd-shim-kata-v2" } } }
   ```

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl reload docker
   docker info --format '{{json .Runtimes}}' | grep -q kata
   ```

3. Select the hypervisor. The Go runtime reads `/etc/kata-containers/configuration.toml` first. Point it at one VMM per pass:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/kata-containers
   sudo ln -sf /opt/kata/share/defaults/kata-containers/configuration-qemu.toml \
       /etc/kata-containers/configuration.toml
   ```

4. Confirm a VM. The guest kernel differs from the host's:

   ```sh
   uname -r
   docker run --rm --runtime kata debian:trixie-slim uname -r
   ```

5. Run the container suite, as the `gvisor` CI job does, for hax and then claude:

   ```sh
   make image AGENT=hax RUNTIME=docker
   RUNTIME=docker AGENT=hax NETWORK=sanduk-kata OCI_RUNTIME=kata uv run pytest -q -m container
   ```

   This covers the `/work` round trip under sanduk's hardening flags, egress blocked on the internal network, the relay on the gateway, the key kept out, a wakeup, and two concurrent `sealed` runs.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 with `configuration-clh.toml`, then `configuration-fc.toml`. Firecracker is expected to fail: it has no filesystem sharing, and its Kata configuration needs a block-device snapshotter such as devmapper that Docker's default does not supply (inference). Record the failure as the result.

7. Record in the table above: runtime and Kata versions, docker-ce version, which tests passed, and the first error for any that failed. Then tear down:

   ```sh
   docker network rm sanduk-kata
   ```

   Remove the `kata` entry from `daemon.json` and reload Docker when done. `/opt/kata` and `/etc/kata-containers` are left for a later pass.

Not planned: a CI job. Whether GitHub-hosted runners expose `/dev/kvm` is unverified, and a 1.2GB download per run is the cost if they do.

## Alternative

Rootless Docker or Podman limits what a kernel escape reaches, with no VM. It narrows the impact rather than adding a boundary, and Podman's rootless networking rules out the relayed modes ([podman.md](podman.md)).

Docker Sandboxes (`sbx`) give a microVM per sandbox but replace the relay's policy and require a Docker account. Not integrated; see [sbx.md](sbx.md).

## Correction

A widely copied summary says Firecracker cannot pause. It can: `PATCH /vm` pauses and resumes it, and snapshots are supported ([snapshot-support.md](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md)).
